# Data-Analysis-Regression-Group-Project

In this project, we aim to construct a predictive model of housing prices to explore how various housing
characteristics impact the price of houses. The dataset we used was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset/data) and describes
housing prices located in the Northeastern United States in 1970. It contains 545 observations and we
selected 6 variables to analyze:

- Price (numeric continuous): Measure of the house cost in an undisclosed unit

- Area (numeric continuous): Measures the house size in an undisclosed unit

- Bedrooms (numeric discrete): The count of bedrooms per house

- Bathrooms (numeric discrete): The count of bathrooms per house

- Mainroad (categorical): Indicates whether the house is located on a main road

- Furnishing status (categorical): Indicates whether the house is unfurnished
